## Functions:
### what does it mean?
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to make a task. A JavaScript function is only executed if "something" invokes it (calls it).

### The structure:

function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {

  // code to be executed

}

### Function Invocation

The code inside the function will execute (be done) when "something" invokes (calls) it:

- When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
- When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
- Automatically (self invoked)

### The benefits of using Functions?

Reusability: You can reuse codes many times, and produce different results.
