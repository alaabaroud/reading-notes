What is Amazon S3?
Amazon S3 is object storage built to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere. It's a simple storage service that offers industry leading durability, availability, performance, security, and virtually unlimited scalability at very low costs.



to add S3 to your app: 
- write this command (amplify add storage).
- follow the following :
 ``` java 
? Please select from one of the below mentioned services:
    `Content (Images, audio, video, etc.)`
? You need to add auth (Amazon Cognito) to your project in order to add storage for user files. Do you want to add auth now?
    `Yes`
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration?
    `Default configuration`
? How do you want users to be able to sign in?
    `Username`
? Do you want to configure advanced settings?
    `No, I am done.`
? Please provide a friendly name for your resource that will be used to label this category in the project:
    `S3friendlyName`
? Please provide bucket name:
    `storagebucketname`
? Who should have access:
    `Auth and guest users`
? What kind of access do you want for Authenticated users?
    `create/update, read, delete`
? What kind of access do you want for Guest users?
    `create/update, read, delete`
? Do you want to add a Lambda Trigger for your S3 Bucket?
    `No`
    ```
- then push (amplify push).

- add these dependencies :
``` java
 implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-storage-s3:1.30.0'
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-auth-cognito:1.30.0'
   ```
- sync and add these to your oncreate :
Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSCognitoAuthPlugin());
Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSS3StoragePlugin());

- add these try and catch to your code :
``` java
try {
        BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(exampleFile));
        writer.append("Example file contents");
        writer.close();
    } catch (Exception exception) {
        Log.e("MyAmplifyApp", "Upload failed", exception);
    }

    Amplify.Storage.uploadFile(
            "ExampleKey",
            exampleFile,
            result -> Log.i("MyAmplifyApp", "Successfully uploaded: " + result.getKey()),
            storageFailure -> Log.e("MyAmplifyApp", "Upload failed", storageFailure)
    );

```
