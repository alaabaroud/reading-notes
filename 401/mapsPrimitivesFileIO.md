- There are two types in java: the primitives like int and boolean, and the reference types like Integer and Boolean. And there is a connection between the primitive and reference types happens behinde the scenes. Autoboxing is the process of transforming a primitive type to a reference type.

- primitive types takes some bits of the memory, But Reference types take more bits from the memore compared to the primitive time. 
for Example: 
- the primitive boolean takes 1 bit But the reference Boolean takes 128 bits.
