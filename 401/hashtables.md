 ## Read: Hash Tables

 **hashtable** (hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.

any algorithm that returns a string and convert it into any other kind of value is called hash. and Each index of an array is a bucket. and when more than one value gets hashed this is called Collisions.
- we use these methods for a useful things such as  : Hold unique values, Dictionary, Library.

The primary concept behind a hashtable is the ability to rapidly retrieve the information by storing the key in the data structure. This is accomplished through the use of a hash. A hash is the ability to encode a key that will eventually map to a specific spot in the data structure that we can look at to retrieve the item directly.


there are some internal methods that we can use :
Add()
Find()
Contains()
GetHash()
to loop over an array that is hashed.
