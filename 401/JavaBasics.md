# Java-Basics
***Variable*** are used in Java as the words (keys) we are assigning value to.
Ex : 
int zero = 0;
String catName = "mimi"
int is one of the data types used in java that represents numbers, and there are more! such as String, boolean, array and others.
there are two kinds of data types:
- primitive data Types such as :
    - boolean
    - char
    - byte
    - short
    - int
    - long
    - float
    - double 
- Reference Data Types such as:
    - Array
    - String
    - Escape Sequences
    

***Operators*** if you want to deal with java you must deal with operators, which are the fixed symbols used by java developers to make some math which compute value.

| ----------- | ----------- |
|Operators|	Precedence|
|postfix	|expr++ expr--|
|multiplicative|	* / %|
|additive	|+ -|
|shift	|<< >> >>>|
|equality	|== !=|
|bitwise AND|	&|
|logical AND|	&&|
|logical OR|	|| |
|ternary	|? :|


***Expressions*** in order to compute and assign values we use expressions, that actually what perform the work of java.

 when we declare variables or changing values to it, we are actually working with ***statements*** to let java program make a fully unit execution.

### Control Flow Statements
 are mainly the way we loop or make decisions and conditions to code.

**Compiling** is to convert code from human code to the  machine (01) language. Any error in the code wont allow the program to compile.
