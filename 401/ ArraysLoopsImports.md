 # Read: 02 - Arrays, Loops, Imports

 - developers can combine groups together using **Packages**. it contains all the java files.  first you need to declare the package. 
 there is a default package that provides the fundamental classes that are necessary to make a basic Java app. 
 
        (( java. lang package))

 after the package declaration, you can **import** these three options: 
 -  import javax.swing.*; it  Makes all classes visible but one is used.

 - import javax.swing.JOptionPane;  it Make a single class visible.

 - No import needed.

 there are many common imports as well and here are 3 of it from https://perso.ensta-paris.fr/:
 
 import java.awt.*;	Common GUI elements.
 import java.awt.event.*;	The most common GUI event listeners.
 import javax.swing.*;	More common GUI elements. Note "javax".
 --------------------------------
  some fun facts: 
   - havind imported classes inside one package does not make the file larger.
   - there is no difference if you imported all classes or the classes needed.
 -------------------------------

  # Intro to Loops

  **looping** meaning is to make a feature run until it finally evaluates to false (end of condition)
  in Java there are 4 types of loops: 

 -  for loop:
it  allows developers to repeat an operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.

 -  for-each loop:
 - While loop:
  It repeats a statement or statements while its non stop if it's evaluation is true.
 - Do-While loop:
 its like the while loop but with an additional condition that happens after the first condition.
