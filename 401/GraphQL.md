### So, What is Serverless?
Serverless is a cloud computing execution model that allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers serverless is one of the most used cloud services in upcoming years.

when you deploy the work, it will not be managed by you anymore and the responsibility is on the Cloud vendors. Serverless functions are accessed only as private APIs. To access these you must set up an API Gateway

Most projects have external dependencies, they work along with libraries that are not built into the language or framework itself. You'll use libraries with functionality that includes cryptography, image processing, etc., these libraries can be pretty heavy. Without system-level access, you must package these dependencies into the application itself.
