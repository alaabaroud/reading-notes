I agree with the code of conduct because it will reduce the negative consequences, especially when those consequences are significant and unjust that may harm the developer. and because Computing professionals should be honest about their qualifications. also The values of equality, tolerance, respect for others, and justice govern this principle. Fairness requires that even careful decision processes provide some avenue for redress of grievances.moreover Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts and  Respect privacy and to Strive to achieve high quality in both the processes and products of professional work.
