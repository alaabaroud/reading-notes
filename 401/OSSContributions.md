Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. "Source code" is the part of software that all computer users can contribute in.
the main reason why the open source coding was ever made is to help beginners to practice coding.

Open source software is different. Its authors make its source code available to others who would like to view that code, copy it, learn from it, alter it, or share it. LibreOffice and the GNU Image Manipulation Program are examples of open source software.
