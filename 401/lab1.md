***Variable*** are used in Java as the words (keys) we are assigning value to.
Ex : 
int cadence = 0;
int speed = 0;
int gear = 1; 

***Operators*** are the fixed symbols used by java developers to make some math which compute value.

|logical AND|	&&|
|logical OR|	|| |
|ternary	|? :|

***Expressions*** are  variables, operators, and method invocations  that evaluates to a single value.

 A ***statement*** makes a fuuly unit execution.
 such as:
Assignment expressions
Any use of ++ or --
Method invocations
Object creation expressions

### Control Flow Statements
 are mainly the way we loop or make decisions and conditions to code.

**Compiling** is to convert code from human code to the  machine (01) language. Any error in the code wont allow the program to compile.
