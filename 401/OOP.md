# Read: 04 - OOP


previously we dealt with JavaScript language which is a ***prototype-based object-oriented language***, now we are dealing with Java and it is the same. But what is an **object**?

**Objects** are the way programming languages such as Java and javaScript stores data in ***variables*** and expose its jobs my ***methods***. and that's what makes it dynamic language. 

in java each program has 1 ***class*** or more. and the ***class*** is more like the Blueprint or the Basic structure of the different ***methods***. and different ***methods*** may have some things common, (example: different kinds of bicycles, motors, and cars has tires). in programming, we call this inheritance. when ***methods*** share the same state and behaviors. 

in java, there are some build-in classes that we can access using packages that contain a library (a set of packages) that can make the developers lives easier. 


# Numbers: 
- **Decimals** (example : 15.55): also called the bases 10 because it is based on 10 numbers ( 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) and of course 10 but because it is contained of two numbers, it did now COUNT ^^.
- **Binary Numbers**: (0,1):  binary means two, and it contains two numbers the Zero and the One. and it is also called base 2
- **Hexadecimal Numbers**: if the decimals stop at 9, Hexadecimal can continue till 16 ^^. and the numbers from 9 till 15 will be referred to as ABCDEF  place of the decimal numbers.
