# Rest
- (REST) is used as an architectural method to desining web serveces. It's also an architectural style for creating hypermedia-based distributed systems.

- HTTP is the application protocol used by REST API implementations.

- Client applications can use any language or toolset that can make HTTP requests and read HTTP responses, while REST web services can be implemented in ASP.NET.


- REST APIs are bulit on resources, which object of all kinds, data, or anything can be accessed by the client.

- An identifier, which is a URI that uniquely identifies a resource, is assigned to it.

- HTTP methods used by  REST web APIs are:

        - GET
        - POST
        - DELETE

- Avoid web APIs that expose a high number of tiny resources because they are "chatty." like when  having to send many requests to get all of the data it needs from such an API.
