- according to Wikipedia
- "unctional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data".


- what is a pure functiocn: 
    1- it produces the same result, if Given the same arguments.
    2 - has no side-effects.



- if we use pure function code, the code will be easy to read and test and thats one of the benefits.
- easy to combine, debug parallelize.

- When data is immutable, it can't change its state once it's been produced. It is impossible to alter an immutable object. Instead, you make a new object and assign the new value to it.

- Referential transparency is the pure functions and immutable data combined .


-------------------------------
- A module is nothing more than another JavaScript file.

- require  reads and executes a JavaScript file before returning the exports object.
