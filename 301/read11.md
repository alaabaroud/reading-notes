# what is OAuth:
- it standes for Open Authentication. 

- it is an authorized protocol that secures the websites form any unrelated servers to prevent any unwanted access without sharing the initials, related, single logon credential.

- it was first opened at 2010 as  RFC 5849

- sending cloud-stored files to users by email is one example of OAuth.

- it only works on HTTPS

- the steps :
    - the websites get to connect on behalf of the user.
    - site generates a one-time token to the deal and the parties involved.
    - The initiating user's client software receives this token and secret from the initial site.
    - The request token and secret are presented to the authorization provider by the client's software.
    - he client will be asked to verify their identity.and if approves?
    - The user is given an access token that has been approved. and return it back to the site.
    - The second website allows the first website to access the user's account. and it is completed successfully 

- OpenID is another security solution.
