 # HTML
- HTML elements are used to divide the webpage into headings, paragraphs.. and so on.
- they also can make some changes in the text such as bold, italic, emphasis.
- headings starts from h1 all the way to h6.
- we can make paragraphs by adding (<p> </p>)
# CSS

- css make boxes for the HTML elements and we use it to style the HTML and let it be more beautiful and attractive.
- there are more than one way to use the CSS , the internal,inline, and the external.
- it can be in a seperate sheet (the style sheet). or inside the style attribute.
- selecto means the part we choose to make changes on such as p or id/class.
- declaration is the changing method we are doing to the selector such as changing colors.

# JAVAScript
- codes will stop running when they find the script tag to make sure that nothing needs to be done. thats why developers put script tag at last (to make the page load)

- Variables works as a storage for information.
- Arrays can store more than one piece of information.
