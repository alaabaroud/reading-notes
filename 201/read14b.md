# working in groups.
 In many universities, making teams was essinsial for many reasons, it makes students socialise, and it makes the ***work faster***. Teams can let the working easier for some people, and be a **nightmare** for others, who do not like to join groups and prefere to work by themselves. but in general, the benefits of working in groups are much more helpful for students.

in fact, the philosophy of working together in groups is something that people cannot be sure about, because some groups work well, and some groups be a massy group, so it depends on the group itself.
