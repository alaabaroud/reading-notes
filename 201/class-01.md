# HTML & CSS
- it is the page that we put the content in.
- HTML uses tags inside <>, some of them needs closing tags *BUT* not all.
- tags = elemnts.
- opening tags can carry attributes such as style.
- attributes needs name ans value.
- we start with doctype to tell the browser which version of HTML we're using.
- we can add comments by (<!--comment-->) 
- id and class attributes allow you to identify specific elements>
- The new HTML5 elements i XX ndicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.

- The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div>  elements).

-  Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements. 

- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

- it is important to know your audience well.
- you need site map to plan the structure of your site.
- you can change the size, color, style as much as you want.

# Javascript
- it makes the web page more attractive.
- it allows the user to interact with the web page,
- A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
- Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
- To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help)
