# HTML & CSS
- it is the page that we put the content in.
- HTML uses tags inside <>, some of them needs closing tags *BUT* not all.
- tags = elemnts.
- opening tags can carry attributes such as style.
- attributes needs name and value.
- we start with doctype to tell the browser which version of HTML we're using.
- we can add comments by (<!--comment-->) 
- id and class attributes are to identify a specific elements.
-  Older browsers may not recognise HTML5 elements, we should modify which elements are block-leve. 
- it is important to know your audience well.
- you can change the size, color, style as much as you want.
