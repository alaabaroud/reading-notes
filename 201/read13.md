# Local storage:

it is a way to store data locally inside the user's browser.
- the attempts to do local storage before HTML5 way not that good (not satisfying to web developers and users).
- the web storage is now a separate specification, before it was a part of HTML5.
- it is basically a way to store the key and the value even if we closed the tab or did anything, it will be stored there.
- every browser now supports this storage.
- but you still need to check if it supports it.
