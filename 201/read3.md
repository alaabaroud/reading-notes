# CSS Boxes:

- CSS treats HTML elements as boxes.
- in css you can control these boxes. By controlling the dimensions, borders, margins and padding. 
- to control the dimension use the height and width properties. By using pixles, percentage, or em.
- there is a way called limiting width, min-width, max-width, to indicate the max/min width a box can be.(same for hight)
- overflow controls the content if it was in a larger box than itself: hidden (to hide the extra content)or scroll (to add a scrollbar)
- borders: every box has a border no matter how small it is 
- margin: is to make a gap between boxes borders.
- padding: padding is inside the content.
